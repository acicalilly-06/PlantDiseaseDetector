# 🌿 Plant Disease Detector

A deep learning–based image classification project for detecting plant leaf diseases using computer vision.

This system classifies plant leaf images into **three categories**:

* **Healthy**
* **Powdery** (Powdery Mildew)
* **Rusty** (Rust Disease)

The model uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to learn visual patterns such as discoloration, texture changes, and fungal infection marks directly from leaf images.

## 📌 Project Overview

Early detection of plant diseases is critical to prevent crop loss. Manual inspection is slow, error-prone, and requires expertise. This project automates the process by analyzing leaf images and predicting plant health conditions accurately and efficiently.
